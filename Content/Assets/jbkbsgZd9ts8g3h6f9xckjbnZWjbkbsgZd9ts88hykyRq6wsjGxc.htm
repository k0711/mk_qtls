<div class="workbookcontent"><a name="jbkbsgZd9ts88hykyRq6wsjGxc"></a><div class="titlewrapper"><h3></h3></div><div class="webfoliomaincontent containerwrapper"><div class="sectiontextonly"><p><span>Here is my self-evaluation, in the form of a SWOT analysis. The points made are the outcome of earlier assessments, peer dialogue and appraisal, and reflections arising in the course of compiling this webfoilo. </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>STRENGTHS</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>1. Commitment. I am passionately committed to teaching. I cannot think of anything more rewarding than seeing students flourish, and I put my heart and soul into the job. It is a measure of this commitment that I am currently self-funding most of my training and career development activities.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>2. Person skills. I work well with people. I have a friendly and positive attitude, communicate clearly, listen well, enjoy team-working, am sensitive to othersâ€™ needs and appreciative of their strengths, and can enthuse and motivate those around me.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>3. Flexible and empowering teaching. I am a creative teacher, who treats students as active and reflective partners in the learning process and uses enquiry-based methods and differentiated teaching. </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>4. Philosophical training. I draw on my philosophical training to empower students by developing their skills in critical thinking and analysis.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>5. Problem-solving skills. I am a resourceful person and am good at thinking on the spot. I can deal calmly with difficult people and situations and can manage change effectively.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>WEAKENESSES</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>1. Leadership skills. I have some experience of leadership roles, and believe I have the qualities needed for success in them, including good skills in communication, team-working, and crisis-management. However, I feel I need more formal training in the area, in order to enhance my understanding of the various dimensions of a leadership role and to develop my skills in dealing with them.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>2. Lack of advanced training. Although I have worked in education for many years, and have higher academic degrees in my specialism, I do not have the advanced teaching qualifications that I may need to progress further in my career.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>3. Gaps. Like everyone, I have gaps in my knowledge and skills, which I am continually seeking to repair. Recently I have been aware of the need for updating my skills in primary school science teaching. </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>4. Over-commitment. I enjoy my work, relish new challenges, and always like to help. The downside of this is that I am reluctant to decline requests for help, and hence tend to be become overcommitted. </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>OPPORTUNITIES </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>1. Return to UK. The main opportunity I see lies in relocating back to the UK and finding a teaching post there. Though I have dual British and Greek nationality, I regard Britain as my home, and career prospects and opportunities for CPD will be much better there. </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>2. QTLS application. I see my current application as an opportunity to consolidate my formal and informal teaching qualifications and give fresh impetus to my career. At the same time, my membership of IfL will open new opportunities for career development. </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>3. Philosophy for children. I currently have opportunities to join European organisations for the promotion of teaching philosophy to children (and also to adults in non-academic settings). This is something that interests me very much. </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>4. PhD completion. After many years' work, I am at last on the point of completing my PhD thesis. This will give my career a boost and allow me to focus on new areas for professional development and academic activity. </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>THREATS</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>1. Location. Currently the biggest threat to my professional development comes from my location in Greece, which cuts me off from many training opportunities in the UK.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>2. Lack of job security. I am currently on temporary, yearly contracts and have to reapply for my job at the end of every school year. This creates insecurity, especially during the lengthy and complex appointment procedure over the summer, and makes long-term career planning difficult. </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>3. Lack of CPD support. Greek schools offer limited CPD support in general, and very little to temporary staff. There is a chance for review at the end of each term (see this recent </span><a href="jbkbsgZd9ts88dgxjrMnjpct7W.htm" target="_blank"><span>report</span></a><span>), but the staff member has to take the initiative (as I do). </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>4. Lack of support for training. My current post offers very limited leave provision for training and little or no financial support for it. Training opportunities have to be fought for.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>5. Financial limitations. The crisis in Greece means that salaries are small and often considerably delayed, creating anxiety and limiting opportunities for self-funded career development activities.</span></p><p><span></span></p></div><div class="clear"></div></div></div></div></div><div class="padfooter"><div class="themegradient"></div></div></div></div><div class="slide-out-handles" style="left: 50%; margin-left: 460px;"><a class="handle comments-tab" style="position: relative" id="comment_tab" target="_blank" href="Info/jbkbsgZd9ts8g3h6f9xckjbnZWInfo.htm"><img src="Icons/infoTab.png" alt="Asset Info"/></a><a class="handle comments-tab" style="position: relative" id="comment_tab" target="_blank" href="Links/jbkbsgZd9ts8g3h6f9xckjbnZWLinks.htm"><img src="Icons/linkTab.png" alt="Asset Links"/></a></div></div></body></html>
