It was clear even then that she was an exceptional teacher, and the testimonials and other evidence in her Professional Formation workbook show that has gone on to do outstanding work in the primary, secondary and further education sectors. The range and depth of her educational work is extraordinary, as is the range of knowledge and skills that she brings to her practice. As her workbook shows, she is incredibly skilled not just in teaching, administration and dealing with people, but also in academic research. As someone who studied philosophy as an undergraduate at the University of Cambridge and who went on to complete a PhD and lecture in it at several top UK universities, I know that Maria’s supervisor, Professor Jennifer Saul, is one of the best philosophers of language in the world. Professor Saul’s testimonial shows very clearly that Maria’s PhD research is exceptional and will generate several papers good enough to be published in top international journals. As someone who has worked in one of the UK’s best state secondary schools for the last six years, and who has mentored an NQT and been involved in many whole-school Teaching and Learning initiatives, I am also very familiar with the standards that UK teachers must meet in order to achieve Qualified Teacher Status. On the basis of the material in Maria’s workbook, I have no doubt that she would meet all of these standards and would exceed them in many areas. Overall, it is clear to me that Maria would be ideally suited to work in the lifelong sector. She is an exceptionally talented teacher and professional and I have no hesitation at all in supporting her application for this award.</div></div><div class="FormInputElementDto_container element" style="position: relative; page-break-inside: avoid;"><h2 class="element-title ng-binding"><div>Please provide any suggestions for the future professional development of the applicant.</div></h2><div class="answer" style="word-wrap: break-word;">The Professional Development Planning section of Maria's workbook shows that she has a very clear understanding of what she needs to do to develop professionally. I support these plans completely, especially her plans to get further training in leadership, advanced teaching skills and teaching philosophy for children. </div></div><div class="FormInputElementDto_container element" style="position: relative; page-break-inside: avoid;"><h2 class="element-title ng-binding"><div>Is there any other information regarding the applicant or their practice which you believe may be relevant for the Society to take into account in determining their application, or which may have a bearing upon the suitability of the applicant to be granted QTLS/ATLS or to appear on the register?</div></h2><div class="answer" style="word-wrap: break-word;">No further information.</div></div><div class="FormOptionListInputDto_container element" style="position: relative; page-break-inside: avoid;"><h2 class="element-title ng-binding"><div>Confirmation</div></h2><div class="answer"><div class="selected option_container_vertical answer"><input checked="checked" disabled="disabled" type="checkbox"><label>I confirm that I have read the information in the application and confirm that this is a true and accurate record of the candidate&#39;s professional standing.
