I do this through various means, including formal appraisal, learner feedback, peer observation, dialogue with colleagues, research, training in ancillary subjects, especially ICT, and online resources and communities. Again, I shall comment briefly on each and supply evidence to illustrate the points.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>All the institutions at which I have taught have had supportive and constructive appraisal procedures, with which I have fully engaged and from which I have benefited greatly. An example from my FE teaching is this </span><a href="jbkbsgZd9ts88mZRZ7dRRbjrsw.htm" target="_blank"><span>audit</span></a><span> from Newcastle-under-Lyme college, which also includes my lesson plan, scheme of work, lesson handout, and self-evaluation. Opportunities for formal appraisal and CPD are more limited in my present post (though I prepare </span><a href="jbkbsgZd9ts88dgxjrMnjpct7W.htm" target="_blank"><span>self-assessments</span></a><span> and receive a short annual </span><a href="jbkbsgZd9ts8843ppwhRh8mMgr.htm" target="_blank"><span>staff assessment</span></a><span>), but to illustrate how seriously I take appraisal procedures, I would this cite this </span><a href="jbkbsgZd9ts88599rRgknkdbcr.htm" target="_blank"><span>preparation document</span></a><span> and this </span><a href="jbkbsgZd9ts888yq6wG7RGkf4y.htm" target="_blank"><span>report</span></a><span> from an one of my appraisal sessions at the OU.)</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>I regard student feedback as an important resource in refining my skills, especially since, where feasible, I practice differentiated teaching. I aim to be continually sensitive and responsive to student experience, and I study feedback questionnaires carefully, analyse them, and draw up action plans. As an illustration, I include this </span><a href="jbkbsgZd9ts8gGqRbxdGwG4sny.htm" target="_blank"><span>report</span></a><span>, in which I analyse student feedback on a philosophy course I tutored. I treat student assessment as a form of feedback too, reflecting the success of my teaching. </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>Peer observation and dialogue is another valuable tool and I have learned much from my colleagues’ observations and suggestions. As examples I include a recent </span><a href="jbkbsgZd9ts88qH9prdrdh9qjW.htm" target="_blank"><span>peer observation report</span></a><span> by a current colleague and also a sample of my own </span><a href="jbkbsgZd9ts8gjqzt6GwMhcgnM.htm" target="_blank"><span>feedback</span></a><span> to peers from my time at the OU. Team meetings are also useful venues for sharing good practice, and my colleagues and I typically hold briefing sessions on any training we have attended. </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>I try to keep up with research in educational theory, using the academic resources available to me through the University of Sheffield. My approach to teaching is eclectic and I am always ready to pick up hints for new approaches, methods, and resources. In particular, I am interested in developmental psychology and dual-process approaches to cognitive development (see publication [4] in my </span><a href="jbkbsgZd9ts88kWrnW96MW3ZxM.htm" target="_blank"><span>CV</span></a><span>). </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>With regard to ancillary courses, I am very lucky to have worked for several years for the Open University, an institution committed to innovation in teaching methods, resources, and technology. During my time with the OU I took numerous in-house training courses, including ones in diversity, course design, accessibility, online conferencing, ICT in courses, e-tuition and online tutoring, and mentoring (see my </span><a href="jbkbsgZd9ts8gj57szjMZ3MZzW.htm" target="_blank"><span>Learning and Development record</span></a><span>. In my current post in-house training opportunities are more limited, but I have benefited from courses in team-working and new technology such as interactive whiteboards. </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>Recently, I have begun to explore online teaching resources and communities, which afford valuable opportunities for CPD and sharing of good practice (for more on this, see the Professional Development section). I have also expanded my own online presence, creating a </span><a href="http://mariakasmirli.com/" target="_blank"><span style=" color: #0000ff;">personal website</span></a><span> and blog, </span><a href="http://mariakasmirli.com/blog/" target="_blank"><span style=" color: #0000ff;">Live Learning</span></a><span>, where I post reflections on teaching practice, comments on education policy, and discussions of philosophical topics. Readers can leave comments on my posts and this promises to be a useful forum for discussion. </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>I have also had valuable opportunities to extend my skills by developing new teaching methods and resources. I will mention two instances, both from my time at the OU. </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>The first involved piloting e-tuition on a major OU philosophy course, as an alternative to traditional face-to-face tutorials (which present access problems for some students). I was contracted to organize the pilot and also to teach on it as an Associate Lecturer. This was a hugely valuable experience for me, during which I learnt how to rethink face-to-face teaching methods for an online environment and got to grips with the technology for both synchronous and asynchronous conferencing. See my </span><a href="jbkbsgZd9ts8gr8d6Hrxrr4HWr.htm" target="_blank"><span>report</span></a><span> on the pilot, which also includes student feedback and samples of my teaching materials.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>A second opportunity involved writing course material for OU students. To combat the high drop-out rate on its foundation course, the Philosophy Department decided to prepare an introductory booklet to give prospective students a taste of philosophy and help them prepare for the course. After a draft from another academic was rejected, I was asked to prepare this material, which I did with pleasure. Again, the experience was highly instructive. Like all OU course material my draft had to go through a process of rigorous peer review, and I learned much about writing distance-learning material and preparing self-assessment exercises. (See the resulting </span><a href="jbkbsgZd9ts88fgrpw47Zj74MM.htm" target="_blank"><span>booklet</span></a><span> and Dr Nigel Warburton’s </span><a href="jbkbsgZd9ts8gZnktgkz66GGrw.htm" target="_blank"><span>comments</span></a><span> on it.) Although the course for which the material was originally written is no longer presented, the OU still offers my booklet as a free </span><a href="http://www.open.edu/openlearn/history-the-arts/culture/philosophy/introducing-philosophy/content-section-0" target="_blank"><span style=" color: #0000ff;">stand-alone module</span></a><span> on its OpenLean site.</span></p><p><span></span></p></div><div class="clear"></div></div></div></div></div><div class="padfooter"><div class="themegradient"></div></div></div></div><div class="slide-out-handles" style="left: 50%; margin-left: 460px;"><a class="handle comments-tab" style="position: relative" id="comment_tab" target="_blank" href="Info/jbkbsgZd9ts8g3h6f9xckjbnZWInfo.htm"><img src="Icons/infoTab.png" alt="Asset Info"/></a><a class="handle comments-tab" style="position: relative" id="comment_tab" target="_blank" href="Links/jbkbsgZd9ts8g3h6f9xckjbnZWLinks.htm"><img src="Icons/linkTab.png" alt="Asset Links"/></a></div></div></body></html>
