<div class="workbookcontent"><a name="jbkbsgZd9ts88h8466fzsmxczw"></a><div class="titlewrapper"><h3></h3></div><div class="webfoliomaincontent containerwrapper"><div class="sectiontextonly"><p><span>Of the training I have recently completed, I will mention (1) the conference on teaching ecocitizenship, (2) the workshop in creative writing, and (3) science teaching training week. (For details see under Subject Currency.)</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>1. Ecocitizenship conference. The main thing I took from this event was the idea that students’ interest in science can be stimulated by engaging them as (peaceful, non-political) environmental ‘activists’. By encouraging students to see themselves as ecocitizens and to take on active responsibility for their environment, one also stimulates them to develop and apply their scientific knowledge. I think this is an attractive approach, and early in March I shall be meeting with local representatives of the World Wildlife Fund to develop a project in which my class will ‘adopt’ a local river. This will involve making trips to the river, investigating and cataloguing the river ecosystem, doing chemical analyses, and then producing written and visual materials for the WWF to use in their guides and brochures. I will also be blogging and reporting to colleagues on this work and on the value of the ‘activist’ approach.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>2. Creative writing workshop. The main lesson from this workshop was that we cannot simply expect students (or ourselves) to be creative; creativity requires stimulation, and we have to learn and practise skills and techniques for stimulating our creativity. In other words, creativity needs scaffolding as much as any other kind of learning. The workshop introduced various techniques (games, etc.) that could be used in this role, and I am currently experimenting with these with my students. The results so far have been good and my students are working on a class contribution to a creative writing competition. Again I plan to blog about the results.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>3. Pri-Sci-Net science training week. The was a rich and stimulating event, which I am still reflecting on. The overarching lesson was that in order to engage students in science, it is better to start by focusing on the method of scientific inquiry rather than the content. The important thing is to get students thinking scientifically rather than simply accumulating scientific facts. The point is not that facts are unimportant, but that engagement with the subject and its methods of enquiry are the basis on which successful science study is built. I am planning to reflect in detail on the various sessions and their impact on my practice, and will be posting my thoughts on my blog. The first post is already up – see this </span><a href="jbkbsgZd9ts88spbjfqkgwnn8y.htm" target="_blank"><span>printout</span></a><span>. </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>With regard to future training, the first three items in my plan (better CPD support, advanced teacher training, leadership training) are focused primarily on my personal professional development – on enhancing my skills in reflection, analysis, and decision making, on equipping myself with the skills and knowledge needed to take on additional roles, and on updating my knowledge of UK educational policies and practices. This will of course feed into my practice in multiple ways, but the cumulative effect will be to further professionalise my practice and enable me to make the most effective use of my teaching and administrative skills.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>Finally, I expect my participation in organisations for philosophy for children will impact on my practice in four main ways. First, it will extend my skills in presenting philosophical topics to newcomers, both children and adults. Laypeople (children especially) find philosophical questions fascinating, but inventive scaffolding is needed if they are to get to grips with them effectively. I have a lot of experience in this area, but I am sure I will learn new approaches and techniques through dialogue with colleagues in EPIC and SOPHIA. Second, participation in these organizations will give me opportunities to practice my skills in new contexts and with new categories of learner, thereby extending my experience and confidence. Third, I expect that involvement with these bodies will stimulate me to reflect further on my professional status as a teacher of philosophy and to enhance my awareness of issues within the profession. Finally, I hope to conduct academic research on pedagogical theory in this area, drawing on my expertise in communication theory and interests in developmental psychology, and I am sure that engagement with other professionals working in the field will stimulate this. </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span></span></p></div><div class="clear"></div></div></div></div></div><div class="padfooter"><div class="themegradient"></div></div></div></div><div class="slide-out-handles" style="left: 50%; margin-left: 460px;"><a class="handle comments-tab" style="position: relative" id="comment_tab" target="_blank" href="Info/jbkbsgZd9ts8g3h6f9xckjbnZWInfo.htm"><img src="Icons/infoTab.png" alt="Asset Info"/></a><a class="handle comments-tab" style="position: relative" id="comment_tab" target="_blank" href="Links/jbkbsgZd9ts8g3h6f9xckjbnZWLinks.htm"><img src="Icons/linkTab.png" alt="Asset Links"/></a></div></div></body></html>
